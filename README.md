# mp3-collection-simplifier
Some cars like the Nissan Leaf have some strange requirements on the MP3 collections.  Although there's no
limit on the size of the USB sticks, they may have some strange requirements such as:
* Number of files
* Number of directories
* Number of files per directory
* No support for unicode filenames
* No support beyond vanilla MP3 encoding
